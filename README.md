- 👋 Hi, I’m Kexun Shen, a college student in Zhejiang University in Hang zhou, China.
- My major is Physics ! Ta da ~
- I’m currently learning Plasma Physics in IFTS. That's why I register on github, to find more codes to fulfill my projects. And maybe ? post some codes of my work here.
- I’m interested in Sports (Badminton), Music and Rubiks Cube (3x3 & 2x2).
- How to reach me: if you want to talk about my work, contact kxshen10@zju.edu.cn
